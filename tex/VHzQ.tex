We assemble a catalogue of 463 spectroscopically confirmed very high
($z\geq5.00$) redshift quasars and report their near ($zZyYJHK_{s}$
and $K$) infrared and mid-infrared (WISE) properties.  Using archival
WFCAM/UKIRT and VIRCAM/VISTA data we check for photometric variability
in the near-infrared that might be expected from super-Eddington
accretion and find {\it blah}.  Extrapolating the known quasar
luminosity function we suggest that $x$\% of the possibly detected
$z\geq5$ quasars in the current datasets have been discovered.  All
the data, analysis codes and plots used and generated here can be

\section{Introduction}
Very high redshift quasars (VH$z$Q; defined here to have redshifts
$z\geq5.00$) are excellent probes of the early Universe. This includes
studies of the Epoch of Reionization for hydrogen \citep[see e.g.][for
reviews]{Fan2006review, Mortlock2016}, the formation and build-up of
supermassive black holes \citep[e.g., ][]{Rees1984, WyitheLoeb2003,
Volonteri2010, Agarwal2016, Valiante2018, Latif2018, Wise2019} and
early metal enrichment \citep[see e.g., ][]{Simcoe2012, Chen2017,
Bosman2017}.

Super-critical accretion, where $\dot{M} > \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, is a
viable mechanism to explain the high, potentially super-Eddington,
luminosity and rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early
universe \citep[e.g.,][]{AlexanderNatarajan2014, MadauHaardtDotti2014,
Volonteri2015, Pezzulli2016, Lupi2016, Pezzulli2017, Takeo2018}. Thus,
one could expect VH$z$Qs to potentially vary in luminosity as they go
through phases of super-critical accretion. These signatures of
photometric variability should be looked for, noting the rest-frame
optical emission is redshifted into the observed near-infrared (NIR)
at redshifts $z>5$. Fortunately, data are now in place from deep,
wide-field NIR instruments and surveys such as the Wide Field Camera
(WFCAM) instrument on the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT)
in the Northern Hemisphere and the VISTA InfraRed CAMera (VIRCAM) on
the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) in the
Southern Hemisphere, that are necessary for identifying VH$z$Qs.

Quasars are known to be prodigious emitters of infrared emission,
thought to be from the thermal emission of dust grains heated by
continuum emission from the accretion disc
\citep[e.g.,][]{Richards2006b, Leipski2014, Hill2014,
Hickox2017}. Observations in the mid-infrared, e.g. $\sim$3-30$\mu$m
allow discrimination between AGN\footnote{Historically, ``quasars''
and ``Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)'' have described different
luminosity/classes of objects. In recognition of the fact that both
terms describe accreting supermassive black holes, we use these terms
interchangeably, with a preference for quasar, since we are generally
in the higher-$L$ regime \citep[e.g.][]{Haardt2016book}.}  and passive
galaxies due to the 1.6$\mu$m ``bump'' entering the MIR at
$z\approx0.8-0.9$ \citep[e.g., ][]{Wright1994, Sawicki2002, Lacy2004,
Stern2005, Richards2006b, Timlin2016} as well as between AGN and
star-forming galaxies due to the presence of Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbon (PAHs) at $\lambda >3\mu$m \citep[e.g., ][]{Yan2007,
Tielens2008}.

\citet{Jiang2006dust} and \citet{Jiang2010} report on the discovery of
a quasar without hot-dust emission in a sample of 21 $z\approx6$
quasars. Such apparently hot-dust-free quasars have no counterparts at
low redshift. Moreover, those authors demonstrate that the hot-dust
abundance in the 21 quasars builds up in tandem with the growth of the
central black hole. But understanding how dust first forms and appears
in the central engine remains an open question \citep{WangR2008,
WangR2011}.

WISE mapped the sky in 4 passbands, in bands centered at wavelengths
of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 23$\mu$m. The all sky `ALLWISE' catalogue
release, contains nearly 750 million detections at
high-significance\footnote{\href{wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/sec2\_1.html}{wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/sec2\_1.html}},
of which over 4.5M AGN candidates have been identified with 90\%
reliability \citep{Assef2018}.  \citet{Blain2013} presented WISE
mid-infrared (MIR) detections of 17 (55\%) of the then known 31
quasars at $z > 6$. However, \citet{Blain2013} was compiled with the
WISE `All-Sky' data release, as opposed to the superior AllWISE
catalogues. That sample only examined the 31 known $z>6$ quasars; our
sample has 170 objects with redshift $z \geq 6.00$ (with 108 detected
in WISE). \citet{Banados2016} reports WISE W1, W2, W3 and W4
magnitudes for the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response
System 1 \citep[Pan-STARRS1, PS1;][]{Kaiser2002, Kaiser2010}, but with
no further investigation into the reddest WISE waveband for the
VH$z$Qs.

Critically, we now have available to us new W1 and W2 photometry from the `unWISE Source Catalog' \citep[][]{Schlafly2019}, a WISE-selected catalogue that is based on significantly deeper imaging and has a more extensive modeling of crowded regions than the ALLWISE release. For the first time in a catalogue, unWISE takes advantage of the ongoing mid-IR Near-Earth Object Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer Reactivation mission \citep[NEOWISE-R; ][]{Mainzer2014}, and achieves depths $\sim$0.7 mag deeper than ALLWISE (in W1/2).  This additional depth is a significant advantage in the detection and study of VH$z$Qs in the 3-5 micron regime.

Here we present for the first time the combined near-infrared
properties (from UKIRT and VIRCAM) and the new mid-infrared unWISE for
all the spectroscopically known $z\geq5.00$ quasars. Our motivations
are numerous and include: {\it (i)} establishing the first complete
catalogue of $z>5.00$ quasars since the pioneering work from SDSS;
{\it (ii)} utilizing all the WFCAM and VISTA near-infrared photometry
available for the quasars; {\it (iii)} making the first study of near-
and mid-IR variability of the VHzQ population and {\it (iv)}
establishing the photometric properties for upcoming surveys and
telescopes including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST)\blindtext\footnote{\href{https://www.lsst.org}{lsst.org};}, ESA {\it
Euclid}\footnote{\href{https://sci.esa.int/euclid/}{sci.esa.int/euclid};}
and the {\it James Webb Space Telescope}
(JWST)\footnote{\href{https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/}{jwst.nasa.gov};}$^,$\footnote{\href{https://sci.esa.int/jwst/}{sci.esa.int/jwst};}$^,$\footnote{\href{https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/jwst/}{www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/jwst};}$^,$\footnote{\href{https://jwst.stsci.edu/}{jwst.stsci.edu}.}. We
chose redshift $z=5.00$ as our lower redshift limit due to a
combination of garnishing a large sample, adequately spanning physical
properties (e.g. luminosity, age of the Universe) and to highlight the
parts of $L-z$ parameter space where $z>5$ quasars still wait to be
discovered.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the
assembled list of the 463 $z\geq5.00$ VH$z$Qs that we have
compiled. We then give a high-level overview of the photometric
surveys and datasets we use and present the photometry of the
VH$z$Qs. In Section 3 we investigate the variability properties of the
VH$z$Qs, looking for evidence of super-critical accretion. In Section
4 we calculate how many $z>5$ quasars we should expect to find in
current datasets. We conclude in Section 5 and present all the
necessary details to obtain our dataset in the Appendices.

We present all our photometry and magnitudes on the AB zero-point
system \citep{Oke_Gunn1983, Fukugita1996}.  This includes the
near-infrared, as well as the mid-infrared magnitudes. These
magnitudes are {\it not} Galactic extinction corrected. We use a flat
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $H_{\rm 0} = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$,
$\Omega_{\rm M} = 0.307$, and $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.693$
\citet{Planck2016} to be consistent with \citet{Banados2016} and all
logarithms are to the base 10.

\section{Method and Data}
Quasars are generally identified by photometric selection followed by
spectroscopic confirmation. Here, we reverse this method obtaining
first a list of spectroscopic quasars and then obtain photometric
information.

We have compiled a list of 463 quasars with redshifts $z\geq5.00$. We
use all the $z\geq5.00$ quasars that have been discovered,
spectroscopically confirmed and published as of 2018 December 31 (MJD
58483). We then obtain optical, near-infrared and mid-infrared
photometry for the spectral dataset. The near-infrared data comes from
two sources: first, the WFCAM \citep[][]{Casali2007} on the UKIRT,
primarly, but not exclusively, as part of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky
Survey \citep[UKIDSS; ][]{Lawrence2007}.  And second, data from the
VIRCAM on the VISTA \citep[][]{Emerson2006, Dalton2006}. The
mid-infrared, $\lambda=3-30\mu$m wavelength data is from the the
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer \citep[WISE;][]{Wright2010,
Cutri2013} mission. For reference, Figure~\ref{fig:filters} displays
the wavelength and normalised transmission of the filters in question.

\subsection{Spectroscopy} 
We compile the list of all known, spectroscopically confirmed
quasars from the literature.  This list was complied from a range of
surveys and papers.  Specifically, we use data from:
\citet{Banados2014, Banados2016, Banados2018}, 
\citet{Becker2015}, 
\citet{Calura2014}, 
\citet{Carilli2007, Carilli2010}, 
\citet{Carnall2015}, 
\citet{Cool2006}, 
\citet{DeRosa2011}, 
\citet{Fan2000, Fan2001c, Fan2003, Fan2004, Fan2006, Fan2018}, 
\citet{Goto2006}, 
\citet{Ikeda2017}, 
\citet{Jiang2008, Jiang2009, Jiang2015, Jiang2016},   
\citet{Kashikawa2015}, 
\citet{Koptelova2017}, 
\citet{Kim2015, Kim2018},  
\citet{Kurk2007, Kurk2009}, 
\citet{Leipski2014}, 
\citet{Mahabal2005}, 
\citet{Matsuoka2016,  Matsuoka2018a, Matsuoka2018b},   
\citet{Mazzucchelli2017}, 
\citet{Morganson2012}, 
\citet{Mortlock2009, Mortlock2011},
\citet{McGreer2006, McGreer2013},  
\citet{Reed2015, Reed2017}, 
\citet{Stern2007},  
\citet{Tang2017}, 
\citet{Venemans2007, Venemans2012, Venemans2013, Venemans2015a, Venemans2015b, Venemans2016},
\citet{WangF2016, WangF2017, WangF2018a, WangF2018b},
\citet{Willott2007, Willott2009, Willott2010a, Willott2013b, Willott2015}, 
\citet{Wu2015} 
\citet{YangJ2018a, YangJ2018b}  
and 
\citet{Zeimann2011}. 

Most of these objects are easily identified by their broad Ly$\alpha$
emission line, \nv emission and characteristic shape blueward of
1215\AA\ in the rest-frame. As we shall see, some of the recently
discovered objects are close to the galaxy luminosity function
characteristic luminosity $M^{*}$, and some have relatively weak or
maybe even completely absorbed Ly$\alpha$ \citep[e.g. Figures 7 and 10
in][]{Banados2016}. We leave aside detailed investigation and
discussion into spectral features and line strengths, and take as
given the published spectra and redshift identifications.

The breakdown of how many VH$z$Q each survey reports is given in
Table~\ref{tab:surveys}. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the
Pan-STARRS1 (PS1; PSO in Table~\ref{tab:surveys}) survey and alone
identified over half (54.6\%) of the VH$z$Q population. Data from the
Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope is responsible for
13.6\% of our dataset (HSC+SHELLQs in Table~\ref{tab:surveys}). The
combination of surveys is also vital for identifying VH$z$Qs. The
UKIDSS Large Area Survey (ULAS) on its own, or in combination with
other surveys is responsible for 6.5\% of the sample (SUV+ULAS)
including the highest-$z$ object. Where more than one survey is used
for the high-redshift identification (e.g. via shorter-band veto and
longer wavelength detection) we follow the discovery paper naming
convention.

The redshifts for the VH$z$Qs generally come from the measurement of
broad UV/optical emission lines. There are far infra-red emission
lines e.g. \cii 158 $\mu$m available for several objects, but at the
level of our current analysis broadline redshifts are sufficient.

\subsection{Near-infrared photometry}~\label{sec:NIR_data} 
The near-infrared data in this paper comes from the Wide Field
Astronomy Unit's \href{https://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/wfau/}{(WFAU)}
Science Archives for UKIRT-WFCAM, the WFCAM Science Archive
\citep[WSA; ][]{Hambly2008} and VISTA-VIRCAM, the VISTA Science
Archive \citep[VSA; ][]{Cross2012}. These archives were developed for
the VISTA Data Flow System \citep[VDFS][]{VDFS}.

We access both the WSA and the VSA and include all non-proprietary
WFCAM data, which covers all public surveys and PI projects from
Semester 05A (2005-05-01) to 2017-Jan-01, and all non-proprietary VISTA data, which
covers all public surveys and PI projects from science verification on
2009-Oct-15 to 2017-Jan-01.

Here we are not just querying the WSA or VSA data tables. We are
taking a list of objects (positions) are performing matched aperture
(``forced'') photometry on the NIR imaging data. As such, we generate
a set of tables that are different in subtle ways to the regular
``Detection'' tables.  The two most important tables for our needs are
the {\tt [w/v]serv1000MapRemeasurement} and {\tt
[w/v]serv1000MapRemeasAver}.

We produce and provide a two new databases with all the necessary
quantities and measurements to fully reproduce our tables, figures and
results herein. Moreover, these databases report considerably more
information than we report here. Full documentation can be found at
the \href{http://wsa.roe.ac.uk/www/wsa_browser.html}{WSA Schema
Browser} and the
\href{http://horus.roe.ac.uk/vsa/www/vsa_browser.html}{VSA Schema

  The data was processed using a matched-aperture photometry method
  where flux is measured at the spectroscopic position of the quasar,
  without necessarily knowing if there is a formal detection in the NIR
  photometry beforehand. The matched-aperture pipeline is discussed in
  \citet{Cross2013} and with fuller details to appear in a forthcoming
  paper (Cross et al., 2019, in prep).
  
  We query the WSA and VSA performing matched-aperture photometry at
  the positions of our 463 VH$z$Qs. This database is world-readable and
  we give the full recipe and relevant SQL queries for accessing both
  databases in Appendix~\ref{sec:SQL} as well as online. 
  
  The photometry in a single epoch image often has low
  signal-to-noise.  The advantage of matched aperture photometry on
  quasars is that co-adding is relatively simple if each epoch is taken
  in the same aperture and the aperture photometry has been corrected to
  total. Indeed, the standard aperture corrections work well for point
  sources. Coadding using the matched-aperture photometry can give better results for the photometry, 
  where the individual epochs are taken from multiple projects with different field-centres and orientations and point-spread functions since the individual epoch scattered light, pixel distortion and aperture corrections can be applied with the correct weighting.
   
  We average the aperture corrected calibrated fluxes (e.g. {\bf
  aperJky3}), and then convert to magnitudes. 

  \begin{equation}
    \bar{F} = \frac{\sum_i^N (w_i\,F_i)}{\sum_i^N w_i}  
    \label{eq:avg}
  \end{equation}
  where $F_i$ is the $i^{th}$ epoch measurement of a parameter to be
  averaged such as the aperture corrected calibrated flux in a $1\arcsec$ aperture
  ({\bf aperJky3}) and $\bar{F}$ is the weighted mean average of this parameter.
  The weight for each epoch $w_i=1/(\sigma_{F})^2$ if the epoch is included and 
  $w_i=0$ if an epoch is excluded for quality control purposes. The weights of each epoch in each averaged catalogue are tabulated in the {\tt [w\v]serv1000MapAverageWeights}.
   
  We calculate a set of averaged catalogues, for each pointing and filter, based
  on the requirements in \verb+RequiredMapAverages+, in these cases over time
  spans of 7, 14, 30, 91, 183 days, 365 days, 730 days, over 10 epochs and
  over all epochs. The averaging process starts at the first epoch and works onwards 
  from there. Again, we present these measurements in the new SQL tables. 

  We detect 359 unique quasars in the WFCAM WSA database, 220 quasars
  are detected in the VISTA VSA database with 130 objects in common with
  both WFCAM and VISTA data.  We give the necessary SQL queries syntax
  at \href{https://github.com/d80b2t/VHzQ/blob/master/data/WSA_VSA/SAMPLE_SQL_QUERIES}{\tt
    d80b2t/VHzQ}.
  

\subsection{MIR data}
The MIR data for this study comes from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission, and we utlize data from the WISE cryogenic and the Near-Earth Object WISE \citep[NEOWISE; ][]{Mainzer2011} post-cryogenic and NEOWISE Reactivation Mission \citep[NEOWISE-R][]{Mainzer2014} survey phases.

We use data from the the beginning of the WISE mission \citep[2010 January; ][]{Wright2010} through the fifth-year of NEOWISE-R operations \citep[2018 December;]{Mainzer2011}.  There are several  major \href{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/wise.html}{data releases} and catalogues based on the WISE mission. Here we use two: the WISE \href{http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/}{AllWISE Data release} and the recently released ``unWISE Catalog'' \citet{Schlafly2019}. The AllWISE program combines the W1 and W2 Single-exposure data from all WISE survey phases (4-Band Cryo, 3-Band Cryo and Post-Cryo; 2010-01-07 thru 2011-02-01) survey phases, and the W3 and W4 from the 4-Band Cryo phase. The unWISE effort\footnote{\href{http://unwise.me}{http://unwise.me}} is the unblurred coadds of the WISE imaging using the AllWISE and NEOWISE-R stacked data \citep{Lang2014, Meisner2018a, Meisner2018b}.

For the two shorter WISE bands, $\lambda_{\rm eff}$3.37$\mu$m W1 and $\lambda_{\rm eff}$4.62$\mu$m W2 we generally report the deeper, unblurred unWISE coadd data.  For the two longer WISE bands, $\lambda_{\rm eff}$12.1$\mu$m and $\lambda_{\rm eff}$22.8$\mu$m we use the ALLWISE Data Release.  

Previous works \citep[e.g., ][]{Krawczyk2013, Ross2015, Bilicki2016} found that cross-matches performed with a radius of 2-3'' between the user catalogue and WISE was a good compromise between completeness and contamination \citep[see e.g. Figure 4 of ][]{Krawczyk2013}. We thus use a cross-match radius of 2.75''. When querying the ALLWISE catalogues, ``Cone Search Radius'' in the ALLWISE table search was set to 2.75'' for the Spatial Constraints. The ``One to One Match'' was ``not'' checked; although possible, we consider it highly unlikely there would be more than one MIR source contributing to the flux of a single UV/optically bright rest-frame quasar. Investigating this in detail is very interesting but left to a future study. 

Knowing we have secure detections in the near-infrared bands, and wanting to boost the number of WISE W3/W4 detections, we allow ourselves to be less conservative in querying the ALLWISE catalogues and also query the AllWISE Reject Table. However, with the exception of one object (SHELLQs  J1208-0200), the ALLWISE Reject Table does not contain any further W3/W4 detection informationn. 

All fluxes in the unWISE catalog are reported there are in ``Vega
nanoMaggies'', with the Vega magnitude of a source is given by
\begin{equation}
m_{\rm Vega} = 22.5 - 2.5\log(f),
\end{equation} 
where $f$ is the source flux. The absolute calibration for unWISE is
ultimately inherited from AllWISE through the calibration of
\citet{Meisner2017a}. This inheritance depends on details of the PSF
normalization at large radii, which is uncertain. Subtracting 4
millimag from the unWISE W1, and 32 millimag from unWISE W2 fluxes
improves the agreement between unWISE and AllWISE fluxes.

Thus to convert unWISE Vega magnitudes onto the AB system, we have:     
\begin{eqnarray*}
        {\rm W1}_{\rm AB, unWISE}  & = &   22.5 - 2.5 \log(f_{\rm W1}) - 0.004 + 2.699 \\
        {\rm W2}_{\rm AB, unWISE}  &  = &  22.5 - 2.5 \log(f_{\rm W2}) - 0.032 + 3.339. 
\end{eqnarray*}
For the our MIR variability investigations, we do not use the unWISE
coadds, but instead use the
\href{http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/}{AllWISE}
catalogue and the NEOWISE
\href{http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/neowise/}{2019 Data
Release}. NEOWISE 2019 makes available the 3.4 and 4.6 μm (W1 and W2)
single-exposure images and extracted source information that was
acquired up until 2018 December 13 (MJD 58465) including the fifth
year of survey operations of NEOWISE. These fifth year NEOWISE data
products are concatenated with those from the first four years into a
single archive from 2013 December 13 (MJD 56639).

The WISE scan pattern leads to coverage of the full-sky approximately
once every six months (a``sky pass''), but the satellite was placed in
hibernation in 2011 February and then reactivated in 2013
October. Hence, our light curves have a cadence of 6 months with a 32
month sampling gap.

Table~\ref{tab:output_table} represents the culmination of this
effort, and we now exam the assembly of its contents in more detail.

\section{Results}
Having collated the sample of 463 VH$z$Qs, and obtained their near-
and mid-infrared photometry we report here the various photometric
properties of the quasars.

First, we will concentrate on detection rate in the infrared, go on to
report on the colour-redshift and colour-colour properties of our sample
and then report on how the current sample populates the
luminosity-redshift $Lz$-plane.

\subsection{Detection Rates in the NIR}
Table~\ref{tab:nir_detection} gives the detection rates for the 
VH$z$Qs in the NIR $YJHK/K_{s}$-bands. 
The first thing to note is that the coverage of the NIR surveys 
for example from the UKIDSS LAS and VISTA VHS, does
not overlap the full area for where the VH$z$Qs are detected. 

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l r l}
    \hline  \hline
    Selection   & number detected (\%) \\
    \hline  
    Any band ($ZYJHK/K_{s}$)    &  449  (97.0) \\
    $Z$-band                            &  75  (16.2) \\
    $Y$-band                            &  273  (59.0) \\
    $J$-band                              &  447  (96.5) \\
    $H$-band                            &  269  (58.1) \\
    $K$ or $Ks$-band                &  322  (69.5) \\
    \hline  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Detection rate of VH$z$Qs in the near-infrared.

been observed but are not in our queried time range, 6 have 
not been observed yet and 5 objects are too far north to be visible 
by UKIRT. }
  \label{tab:nir_detection}
\end{table}

There are 14 objects that have no NIR detections.  3 of these
(PSOJ053.9605-15.7956, PSO J056.7168-16.4769 and DELSJ0411-0907) have
been observed (by VHS) but are out of our queried time range 
(for which the data is publicly available). 6 objects have not been 
observed (or at least the data is not in the
WSA/VSA archives yet) and 5 objects are at a declination $\delta \geq +60$
deg are too far north for UKIRT and cannot be observed.


  \subsubsection{Comparing WFCAM and VISTA}
  There are 130 overlapping QSOs between WFCAM and VISTA. We used the
  {\tt VegaToAB} values to put these objects on the same AB system, and
  for each object compared the two measurements. First, we calculated the
  weighted average (calibrated flux) in each filter of both and
  calculated the ratio and difference between each measurement and the
  average.  Then for each filter we calculated the weighted average of
  the differences (in mag) for each instrument to see if there were
  significant offsets. The results are given in
  Table~\ref{tab:WFCAM_vs_VISTA}.  The only filter with a significant
  offset is the $Y$-band. All of the VISTA averages are negative and all
  of the WFCAM ones are positive. The $Ks$ versus $K$ band comparison may be
  affected the different shapes of the filters, with $K$ being significantly wider than $K_s$.
  \begin{table}

    \begin{tabular}{l r r}

      abs(VIRCAM & \multirow{2}{*}{millimags} &  no. of  \\
      -  WFCAM)      &                                        &  objects \\
      \hline
      $Z$                 &  23.2 	& 3 \\
      $Y$                 &  57.3 	& 53 \\
      $J$                  &    2.1 	& 106 \\
      $H$                 &  45.8     &  96 \\
      $K_{\rm s}$/$K$ &  25.2     & 110 \\

    \caption{Comparing the magnitudes in different WFCAM/UKIRT and 
      VIRCAM/VISTA near-infrared bands.}
    \label{tab:WFCAM_vs_VISTA}
  \end{table}
  
  We have also checked for quasars with large differences in magnitude
  between the WSA and VSA. Objects were selected where the average flux
  was $>0.$ and $>5$ average flux error. In order to account for large
  errors in either the WFCAM or VISTA photometry, objects with deltaMag$
  < 2 \times$ deltaMagErr in either WSA or VSA were removed. This
  selects two quasars with large, $\delta$mag $>0.2$mag differences
  between the WSA and VSA. These are SDSSJ0349+0034 and
  SDSSJ2220-0101. For SDSSJ0349+0034 has a WSA $K$-band magnitude of
  19.13$\pm$-0.24, while for the VSA $K_s$-band this is 18.36$\pm$0.10
  mag. For SDSSJ2220-0101, in $J$-band WSA = 22.23$\pm$0.15, for the VSA
  = 19.38$\pm$0.04.

\subsection{Detection Rates in the MIR}
Unlike the NIR coverage, the WISE satellite and mission performed an all-sky survey, so the location of every VH$z$Q in our dataset is covered. However, the depth of the WISE survey depends heavily on sky location, with locations near the Ecliptic Poles having the highest number of exposures.

Before reporting on the detection rates, we investigate this effect using the AllWISE Source Catalog. Figure~\ref{fig:WISEmag_vs_coverage} shows the WISE ALLWISE magnitude versus signal-to-noise, colour coded by {\tt w$x$cov} the mean coverage depth, in each corresponding band. In the two shorter bands W1/2 we see the clear and expected trend for brighter objects to have larger SNR, and also for the higher signal to noise for objects with more exposures at a given magnitude. The behaviour for the W3/4 bands is different, with two populations clearly evident in W3 and although a bit more mixed, also in W4. With the suggested split at SNR$>2$, and no obvious R.A./Declination dependence seen, this behaviour is explained by the fact that there are non-detectiopns in W3/4 for objects (with high W1/2 SNR) that are reported in the ALLWISE catalogue.
%%AllWISE Source Catalog	

For the 362 VH$z$Q with coverage detections, the mean number of exposures for the W1/2 bands is 32.0 and 31.5, respectively, with a minimum number of exposures 17 and 12, and the maximum number or exposures being 114 (for both bands).  For the W3/4 filters, the corresponding mean, minimum and maximum exposure are 17.4 and 17.5, 5.8 and 6.8 and 69 (for both bands). These values are directly from the {\tt w$x$cov} entries in the WISE \href {http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/sec2_1a.html#w1cov}{ALLWISE catalogue}.

\citet{Blain2013} 

Recently, \citet{Assef2018} released two large catalogues of AGN 
candidates identified across 30,000 deg$^2$ of extragalactic sky 
from the WISE AllWISE Data Release. The ``R90'' catalogue, is 
contains 4.5M AGN candidates at 90\% reliability (and $\approx$150 
AGN candidates per deg$^2$) while the ``C75'' catalogue  
consists of 20.9M AGN candidates at 75\% completeness (and 
($\approx$700 AGN candidates per deg$^2$).  Crossmatching 
out catalogue of 463 VH$z$Qs with these catalogues, produces 
42 matches with	the R90 sample and 98 matches with the C75 sample. 
Both catalogues unsurprisingly match to the ultraluminous quasar 
SDSS J0100+2802 \citep{Wu2015} while the C75, but not the R90 catalogue 
mathes to ULAS J1120+0641 \citep{Mortlock2011}. Neither catalogue 
matches J1342+0928 \citep{Banados2018}.

\subsection{Variability}
VH$z$Qs, if accreting at, or above the Eddington Limit, might well
have have large values of changing mass accretion rate, $\ddot{m}_{\rm
accr}$. A consequence of this would be that these quasar exhibit signs
of variability, most likely showing up in their UV/optical rest-frame
spectra. We look for evidence of this variability signature in the NIR
and MIR light-curves of the VH$z$Qs. As a guide, \civ enters the
$Y$-band at redshift $z$=5.32 and exits at $z$=5.99, and enters the
$J$-band at redshift $z=6.55$ and exits at $z$=7.57. \mgii enters the
$H$-band at redshift $z=4.33$ and exits at $z=5.37$ and enters the
$K$-band at redshift $z=6.25$ and exits at $7.50$.

{\bf NJC: What about NIR light-curves / combined light-curves}

At least 8 original observations across at least 30 days in either WSA or VSA per band, calibrated flux greater than zero over the whole time, and the error on the average flux is 8 times lower than this. 

Thenn a requirement of SNR$>3$ per `average' epoch, where `average epoch' is then dependenet o nthe averaging timescales (whcih as we see can vary). 

Then calculate the clipped median and standard deviation, 
\begin{equation}
1.48 \times \sigma_{median} / \bar{\epsilon}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\epsilon}$ is the mean of the error in each point in the light curve, divided by the total number of points.

With this definition, although some of the objects have very well sampled, 
`average' light curves where you are averaging over e.g. a month, or two weeks. 

Longer time-series, better SNR and moreover, $(1+z)$.

\section{Surface Density of VH$z$Qs}
One interesting question to ask is given the compilation of VH$z$Qs assembled here, 
are there bright $z>5.00$ quasars that are in {\it current} photometric datasets, and if 
so, how many are still to be discovered and confirmed spectroscopcially?

VHS, Area 1: 150$<$RA/deg$<200$ annd $-40<$Decl./deg$<-20$:
$Y$=21.1 mag, $J$=20.6 mag, $H$=20.3 mag, $K_{s}$=19.8 mag (all AB). 
Area 2: 10$<$RA/deg$<$60, $-60<$Dec$<-40$:
$J$=21.2 mag, $H$=20.6 mag, $K_{s}$=20.2 mag. 

VIKING is more uniform, so I calculated the averages over the whole area:
$Z$=22.7 mag, $Y$=21.9 mag, $J$=21.4 mag, $H$=21.2 mag, $Ks$=21.1 mag.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{../data/WSA_VSA/VHS_J_abMagLim.png}
  \caption{The calculated average {\tt AB MAGLIM} in the VHS.
    As one can see, VHS is not completely uniform. The are 3 areas with different filter sets, 
    and the depths changed in 2 of these areas, particularly in $J$ and $K_{s}$. 
    Y and H are almost uniform, but the coverage is much less.}
  \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

Following \citet{Fan2001b} and \citet{McGreer2013}, we use use an
exponential decline to describe the space density of VH$z$Qs at high
redshifts, e.g.
\begin{equation}
\rho(z, {\rm M}_{1450} \propto 10^{k (z)}
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the sample redshift.

VISTA HEMISPHERE SURVEY DATA RELEASE 1
Release date (will be set by ESO)
PROPOSAL ESO No.: 179.A-2010
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Richard McMahon
Authors: R. McMahon, M. Banerji, N. Lodieu for the VHS Collaboration

The aim of the Vista Hemisphere Survey (VHS) is to carry out a near
Infra-Red survey, which when combined with other VISTA Public Surveys
will result in coverage of the whole southern celestial hemisphere
($\sim$20,000 deg$^2$) to a depth 30 times fainter than 2MASS/DENIS in
at least two wavebands (J and K$_s$), with an exposure time of 60 seconds
per waveband to produce median 5σ point source (Vega) limits of $J =
20.2$ and $K_{S} = 18.1$. In the South Galactic Cap, $\sim$5000 deg$^{2}$ will be
imaged deeper with an exposure time of 120 seconds and also including
the H band producing median 5$\sigma$ point limits of: J = 20.6; H = 19.8; K$_{s}$ = 18.5. 
In this 5000 deg$^{2}$ region of sky deep multi-band optical (grizY)
imaging data will be provided by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The
remainder of the high galactic latitude ($|b|>$30$^{\circ}$) sky will be imaged
in YJHK for 60sec per band to be combined with ugriz waveband
observations from the VST ATLAS survey. \\ 

VHS                   YJHK            99.99, 21.2,  21.2,  20.6,  20.0                (9) \\

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this study, we have, for the first time, ompiled the list of all
$z>5$ spectroscopically confirmed quasars. We have assemble the NIR
($y/Y, J, H, K/K_{s}$) and MIR (WISE W1/2/3/4) photometry for these
objects, given their detection rates and SEDs. We find that:

\section{Near-Infrared WFCAM Science Archive SQL queries}\label{sec:SQL}
Here we give the receipe and SQL that returned the near-infrared photometry 
for the VH$z$Qs from the  WFCAM Science Archive. 

The data are on the WFCAM Science Archive: \href{wsa.roe.ac.uk}{\tt wsa.roe.ac.uk}. 
Access the User Login form \href{WFCAM Science Archive}{\tt wsa.roe.ac.uk/login.html} 
with these credentials::
\begin{itemize}
    \item Username: {\tt WSERV1000} 
    \item password: {\tt highzqso} 
    \item community: {\tt nonsurvey}
\end{itemize}
Then going to the
\href{http://wsa.roe.ac.uk:8080/wsa/SQL_form.jsp}{{\tt Free Form SQL
Query}} page the Database release {\tt WSERV1000v20180716} can be
accessed which contains all the data we use here.

We {\it nota bene} a few things. First, the quantity {\tt aperJky3}
and {\tt aperJky3Err} are found in the {\tt wserv1000MapRemeasAver}
and {\tt wserv1000MapRemeasurement}, so care has to be taken to return
unique column names (otherwise e.g.
\href{http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/}{astropy.io.fits}
will crash).  As such, we alias {\tt aver.aperJky3} to {\tt
aperJky3Aver} and likewise for the error quantity. Aliases will be
necessary in some cases anyway, because some queries can be done
sensibly on multiple instances of the same table. Other times, one may
join tables on quantities such as {\tt catalogueID} or {\tt
apertureID}, where you are meaning the same thing, but aliases would
again be sensible.

Second, the {\tt RA} and {\tt DEC} values returned by the WSA are in radians, if
used directly. To return values in degrees, use a selection with an alias, e.g. 
{\tt RA as RADeg} and {\tt DEC as DECDeg}.
