w/vwserv1000MapRemeasurement tables are built upon the Detection Tables.

The Detection tables have a recording of each extracted object, so if
you run your `image extrator', you get you positions, fluxes, etc. and
that goes into the Detection tables.

The *Remeasurement tables have a lot of the Detection table
attributes, but also have crucial differences.

For instance, for the Detection tables, the compound Primary Key (the
way you catalog the object) is based on the MultiFrameID, which is id
of, the multiextension FITS file, plus the MultiFrame extension number
(usually givesn as ExtNum) and finally a Sequence number (running
number from 1 upwards).

Whereas for the MapRemeasurement tables, the Primary Key is the
ApertureID -- which is based on your sources list -- and, catalogueID,
which is just the number of your catalogue (an identifiier for
the/your catalogue).

Another difference between Detection and MapRemeasurement is that you can expect more of the fluxes measurements to be negative, in MapRemeasurement, and indeed some of the objects you might expect *all* the measurements to have negative fluxes in the MapRemeasurement tables.
