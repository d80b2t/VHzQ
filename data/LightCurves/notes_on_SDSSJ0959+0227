Hi Nick, 

Thanks for all these checks. 

So, needed quite a big of digging, but...

SDSS J0959+0227, with R.A., Decl., == 09:59:08.10 +02:27:07.4 and 149.78374999, +002.4520444 
is in our list since it is in Wang et al. 2016, ApJ, 819, 24, and their Table1. However, the reference for 
the Wang table is to Civano et al., 2011, ApJ, 741, 91 (High-redshift, z>3 AGN in Chandra-COSMOS) 
and J0959+0227 is also known as CID-2220, CXOCJ095908.1+022707. 

However, the spectrum from this object actually appears in Ikeda et al., 2012, ApJ, 756, 160, and is 
called object "No. 11” (see that papers Table 1) and it is a beauty!! Figure 2 with the spectrum is attached. 
Now, that’s a super-narrow LyA line, and indeed, this would likely be called a LAE galaxy, but it *is* 
an X-ray source, and indeed has an X-ray luminosity of approx 3x10^44 erg s-1 in the 2–10 keV rest-frame 
band, so it is an AGN. Not a regular broadline ‘Type 1’ AGN, but I see no reason to ‘throw’ this object out. 
Indeed, if there’s even the slightest hint of variability, that could be *exceedingly* interesting…

Thanks, 
Nic

Hi Nic,
I am surprised this is an SDSS QSO, since it is very faint and most of the observations are in UltraVISTA. There is a noticeable brightening by >0.5 mag over 4 years.
Regards,
Nick
