 Purpose
===============================================================
This gives the salient details to (quickly) access the WSA
(WFCAM Science Archive) and VSA (VISTA Science Archive) in order
to obtain the near-infrared ZYJHK photometry for the VHzQ sample.




 Access the WSA
===============================================================
