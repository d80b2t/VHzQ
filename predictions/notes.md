# Predictions for Very High Redshift Quasar (VH_z_Q) surface denisty



## Purpose
Given: 

 * a set of areas and depths (e.g. of the near-infrared WFCAM and VISTA) surveys; 
 * some form of the high-_z_ quasar luminosity function; 
 * a suitable k-correction annd 
 * a redshift range

make a prediction to the surface density (and thus total number) of  VH_z_Qs
