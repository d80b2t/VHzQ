p. 1: You may want to end the first sentence of the right column of the Intro
with a statement that at z>5, relativistic time dilation also stretches the
photometric variability of the accretion disk as observed.

p. 2, Fig. 1: Is it useful here to plot both filter sets if they are sufficiently
different? Please provide larger tick-marks for better readability in any case.

	   Hmmm. I’m not sure what to do here; it’s going to ruin the clarity of the figure
	   having both ZYJHK filter sets, but, they are different.
	   I think adding an explicit link to:
	          d80b2t/VHzQ/SEDs/filters_vs_QSOstars_UKIRT.png
	  and
	         d80b2t/VHzQ/SEDs/filters_vs_QSOstars_VISTA.png
	 is the way forward here.


p. 3, Fig. 3, caption or text: You should briefly comment on why the quasar
distribution has this gap in N(z) at z~5.5?. Is this because of the relativity
sensitivity across the filter curves, and/or the onset of complete GP-troughs at
z>5.7?


	This is Figure 2, not 3.
	And I think this is where some of the missing objects come in??
	We’ll need to update: Tables 1, 2 and obviously 3 once we have those extra objects.


p. 4, Fig. 3: Can you plot the small dots somewhat bigger for better visibility
without loss of information?

p. 5: [My only (minor) scientific comment]: Re: ``although possible, we consider
it highly unlikely there would be more than one MIR source contributing to the
flux of a single UV/optically bright rest-frame quasar. Investigating this in
detail is very interesting but left to a future study. ''

I think it would be better to address now the number of expected contaminating
8--25 micron sources in the apertures used, as it can be done straightforwardly.
E.g., Driver et al. (2016, ApJ, 827, 107; astro-ph/1605.01523) --- the figures
you need for this estimate are actually best given as Fig. A4, A5 on the astro-ph
version. The redshift distribution of the sampled 8--25 micron foreground objects
is narrow enough and their K-corrections advantageous enough, that the objects
counts sharply turnover for AB(W3, W4) > 20--18 mag (left panels), and as a
consequence the normalized differential counts (right panels) --- especially in
W4 --- have most of their EBL energy emerging at AB~18--20 mag. As a consequence,
the relative number or probability of contaminating objects at AB>20 mag inside
your apertures should be rather small. A point worth mentioning, as it helps your
case.

p. 6 Table 3: Should mention that the number of significant digits listed here
for the YJHK W1--W4 mags is not always warranted, but needed to verify the small
VIRCAM-WFCAM offsets in Table 5, This table is a very useful check of your global
photometric zeropoints.

p. 7, very end of 3.1.1: Quote the (effective) VSA and SDSS quasar IR observing
epochs here, in case these clearly discrepant magnitudes are due to variability.

              This is for SDSS J0349+0034 and J2220-0101; NJGC to check.
