\section{Introduction}
Very high redshift quasars (VH$z$Qs, defined here to have redshifts
$z\gtrsim5$) are excellent probes of the early Universe. This includes
studies of the Epoch of Reionization for hydrogen \citep[see e.g.][for
reviews]{Fan2006review, Mortlock2016}, the formation and build-up of
supermassive black holes \citep[e.g., ][]{Rees1984, WyitheLoeb2003,
Volonteri2010, Agarwal2016, Valiante2018, Latif2018} and early metal
enrichment \citep[see e.g., ][]{Simcoe2012, Chen2017, Bosman2017}.

%The build-up of SMBHs via accretion is important due to the desire to understand the evolution of the black hole mass function (BHMF) and since there is a remarkable similarity between cosmic star-formation rate density (SFRD) and black hole accretion rate (BHAR). The SFRD and BHAR trace each other \citep[with a normalisation factor of $\sim3000$,][]{Willott2013b, MadauDickinson2014} across redshifts $z=0-4$.  However, new results \citet[e.g., ][]{Vito2018a, Calhau2018} suggest that the SFRD and BHAR do not have the same evolutionary form at higher, $z>4$ redshifts, for reasons that are currently poorly understood.  For some high-$z$ QSOs we can measure BHAR and SFR: most have BHAR $\gg 10^{-3}$ SFR, indeed {\it Herschel}-detected sources at $z\simeq.8$ have $L_{\rm SF} \simeq L_{\rm AGN}$ \citep[e.g., ][]{Netzer2014}. 
%%However, we also note the potential for the non-causal origins of the
%%black-hole galaxy scaling relations \citep{Jahnke2011}. 

Quasars are also known to be prodigious emitters of infrared emission,
thought to be from the thermal emission of dust grains heated by
continuum emission from the accretion disc \citep[][]{Hill2014,
Hickox2017}.  Observations in the mid-infrared, e.g. $\sim$3-30$\mu$m
allow discrimation between AGN\footnote{Historically, ``quasars'' and
``Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)'' have described different
luminosity/classes of objects, but here we use these terms
interchangeably (with a preference for quasar) in recognition of the
fact that they both describe accreting supermassive black holes
\citep[e.g.][]{Haardt2016book}.}  and passive galaxies due to the
1.6$\mu$m ``bump'' entering the MIR at $z\approx0.8-0.9$ \citep[e.g.,
][]{Wright1994, Sawicki2002, Lacy2004, Stern2005, Richards2006b,
Timlin2016} as well as AGN and star-forming galaxies due to the
presence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAHs) at $\lambda >3\mu$m
\citep[e.g., ][]{Yan2007, Tielens2008}.

\citet{Jiang2006dust} and \citet{Jiang2010} report on the discovery of
a quasar without hot-dust emission in a sample of 21 $z\approx6$
quasars. Such apparently hot-dust-free quasars have no counterparts at
low redshift. Moreover, we demonstrate that the hot-dust abundance in
the 21 quasars builds up in tandem with the growth of the central
black hole,

\citet{Blain2013} presented WISE mid-infrared (MIR) detections of 17
(55\%) of the then known 31 quasars at $z > 6$. However,
\citet{Blain2013} was compiled with the WISE `All-Sky' data release,
as opposed to the superior ``AllWISE'' catalogs. That sample only
examined the 31 known $z>6$ quasars; our sample has 148 objects with
redshift $z\geq6.00$.

Here we update \citet{Jiang2010}  and \citet{Blain2013} 
\citep[along with Table 8 of][]{Banados2016}. 

We chose redshift $z=5.0$ as our lower redshift limit due to a combination 
of garnishing a large sample, adequately spanning physical properties 
(e.g. luminosity, age of the Universe) and to incorporate what knowledge 
we've gained over the last couple of decades since $z>5$ quasars were 
discovered. 

WISE mapped the sky in 4 passbands, in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 23$\mu$m.  In total the release all sky ``ALLWISE'' catalog, contains nearly 750 million detections at high-significance\footnote{\href{http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/sec2\_1.html}{wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/sec2\_1.html}}. \citet{Assef2013}, \citet{Stern2012}

In this paper, we introduce the ``WISE W4 Compendium'' (WW4C); a detailed study into the objects that were detected in the longest waveband, 20-28$\mu$m observed, on the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer \citep[WISE;][]{Wright2010, Cutri2013} mission. This study will describe all 40 million objects that are detected in the WISE W4-band, but will concentrate on those objects most affected by radiating dust emission and well described by extragalactic, and AGN, spectral energy distributions (SEDs).  The motivations of the WW4C are numerous, but the primary science we will pursue is the identification of bolometric luminous AGN, especially those that might not be observered in X-ray/UV/optical surveys. %%

\citet{Brown2014b}, in PASA, is the paper about Recalibrating the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W4 Filter,

This paper can be considered an update of \citet{Blain2013} and also
an extension of parts of \citet{Banados2016}, with the latter study reporting
WISE W1, W2, W3 and W4 magnitudes for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 
\citep[Pan-STARRS1, PS1;][]{Kaiser2002, Kaiser2010}, but with no  
further investigation into the reddest WISE waveband for the VH$z$Qs.
%%
\citet{Banados2016} reports and investigates the W1, W2 and W3 properties
of quasars at $z > 5.6$.

$M_{\rm BH}, M_{\rm bulge}, M_{\star}$ are the SMBH mass, stellar mass of the bulge and 
 galaxy total stellar mass, respectively. 

Because of established conventions, we report SDSS $ugriz$ magnitudes on the AB zero-point system \citep{Oke_Gunn1983, Fukugita1996}, while the WISE W1 − 4 magnitudes are calibrated on the Vega system (Wright et al. 2010). For WISE bands, $m_{\rm AB} = m_{\rm Vega} + m$ where m = (2.699, 3.339, 5.174, 6.66) for W1, W2, W3 and W4, respectively \citep{Cutri2011, Brown2014b}. We make use of the Explanatory Supplement to the WISE All-Sky Data Release, as well as the WISE AllWISE Data Release  Products online. All optical ($ugriz$ bands) magnitudes are given in the AB system, all near-infrared  ($y/YJHK$) are also given in the AB system.  We use a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $H0 = 67.7$ km s$-1$ Mpc$−1$,  $\Omega_{\rm M} = 0.307$, and $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.693$ (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016) in order to be consistent with \citet{Banados2016}.

\input{THE_TABLE_v0pnt96_TOP10}

Table~\ref{tab:THE_TABLE} gives the salient details for the objects
used in this study. We use all the $z\geq5.00$ quasars that
have been discovered and spectroscopically confirmed as of the time of
writing (2018 June). We report near-infrared ($yYJHK$-bands)
and mid-infrared (WISE W1/2/3/4) photometry and give our caculcated 
$M_{1450}$

\subsection{Very high redshift quasars}
In Table~\ref{tab:THE_TABLE} we give the discovery reference for the
VH$z$Qs noting that some objects were discovered independently and
contemporaneously.  The redshifts for the VH$z$Qs generally come from
the measurement of broad UV/optical emission lines. Where 
there are far infra-red emission lines e.g. \cii~158 micron, we report 
these, but at the level of our current analysis broadline redshifts are
sufficient.

\subsection{Optical Photometry}
\subsubsection{Pan-STARRS1 (PS1)} 
We query the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System
(Pan-STARRS)\footnote{\href{https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS}{https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS}}
Data Release 1 (DR1) Catalog Archive Server Jobs System (CasJobs)
service at
\href{http://mastweb.stsci.edu/ps1casjobs/}{mastweb.stsci.edu/ps1casjobs/}.
The PS1 survey observed the 30,000 deg$^{2}$ of sky north of
declination $-30$ degrees in five filters $grizy$.  Pan-STARRS1 (PS1)
is the first part of Pan-STARRS to be completed and is the basis for
the DR1.  \citet{Chambers2016}, \citet{Magnier2016a},
\citet{Waters2016}, \citet{Magnier2016b}, \citet{Magnier2016c} and
\citet{Flewelling2016} describe the instrument, survey, and data
analyses.  The principal science product of the PS1 survey is the
catalog accessible through the CasJobs interface.

We query and return the mean PSF magnitudes from the $grizy$ filters
({\tt MeanPSFMag}) which are in the AB system for our 425 VH$z$Q
sample. Details of our SQL and links to the main tables are given
in~\ref{sec:PS1_SQL}.


%\newpage
\subsection{Near-infrared photometry}
Due to their selection of being very faint/undetected in the
observed-frame optical but bright in the observed frame near-infrared,
VH$z$Qs are generally detected in the near-infrared $yYJHK$-bands
\citep[$\approx$0.98-2.38$\mu$m; e.g., ][]{Peth2011}.

We query the WFCAM Science Archive
\citep[\href{http://wsa.roe.ac.uk/}{WSA}; ][]{Hambly2008} which
reports NIR photometry from the Wide Field Camera \citep[WFCAM;
][]{Casali2007} on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT).
Data from the VIRCAM (VISTA InfraRed CAMera) on the VISTA
\citep[Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy;
][]{Emerson2006, Dalton2006} is also given in the WSA.

Quasars are known to vary (both photometrically and spectroscopically)
and very high-$z$ quasars under going super-Eddington accretion during
a rapid BH growth phase are prime candidates for this variation.
Therefore, with repeat observations over many epochs availble via the
WSA, we have a choice to make for how we report the photometry. After
tests, we decide to give the NIR photometry averaged on 4 week
observed timescales. This time bracket is chosen as a good compromise
between maximising signal-to-noise while keeping the cadence high. At
our observed redshifts, we sample $\lesssim1$week in the rest-frame
and luminous quasars are not expected to vary on timescales quicker
than this \citep[e.g., ][]{Lawrence2016_ASPC}. 
 
We give our recipe and SQL query syntax in Appendix~\ref{sec:SQL}.

\subsection{Filter and Survey choices} 
We make some choices when reporting our archival photometry. 
This includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Report Pan-STARRS1 DR1 $grizy$ wherever we have it; 
\item Report WFCAM $YJHK$ (mainly from the UKIDSS); 
\item Report VIRCAM $YJHK_{\rm S}$ (mainly from the VISTA surveys); 
\item Report VIRCAM $YJH$ over WFCAM  $YJH$; 
\item Report both VIRCAM $K_{\rm S}$ and WFCAM  $K$; 
\item Report DECam $grz$ wherever we have it (mainly from the DES and DECaLS); 
\item Due to lack of coverage, do not report WFCAM $Z$-band. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consequences of evolution of the $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\star}$ relation}
From a study of 69 {\it Herschel}-detected broad-line active galactic
nuclei, \citet{Sun2015} find there is no evolution in the $M_{\rm BH}
- M_{\star}$ relation from $z\sim2$ to $z\sim0$, with the ratio of
$\log (M_{\rm BH} / M_{\star}$ constant at -2.85 across this redshift
range. If this ratio holds to $z>5$, and we assume the $M_{\rm BH}$
for the $z>6$ measured from the e.g. \mgii line, are generally
correct, then the galaxy total stellar mass for the $z>6$ objects
should be...

\citet{YangG2018} calculate the long-term SMBH accretion rate as a
function of $M_{\rm star}$ and redshift $[BHAR(M_{\star} ,z)]$ over
ranges of $\log (M_{\rm star} / M_{\odot}) = 9.5–12$ and $z = 0.4–4$.
Our BHAR(M⋆,z) is constrained by high-quality survey data
(GOODS-South, GOODS-North and COSMOS), and by the stellar mass
function and the X-ray luminosity function.  This BHAR/SFR dependence
on $M_{\star}$ does not support the scenario that SMBH and galaxy
growth are in lockstep.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this study, we have, for the first time, ompiled the list of all
$z>5$ spectroscopically confirmed quasars. We have assemble the NIR
($y/Y, J, H, K/K_{s}$) and MIR (WISE W1/2/3/4) photometry for these
objects, given their detection rates and SEDs. We find that::


\begin{itemize}
    \item{This sample spans a redshift range of $0.28 < z < 4.36$ and has a bimodal distribution, with peaks 
        at $z\sim0.8$ and $z\sim2.5$.}
   \item{We recover a wide range of quasar spectra in this selection.  
        The majority of the objects have spectra of reddened Type 1
        quasars, Type 2 quasars (both at low and high redshift) and objects
        with strong absorption features.} 
    \item{There is a relatively high fraction of Type 2 objects at low redshift,
        suggesting that a high optical-to-infrared colour can be an efficient
        selection of narrow-line quasars.}
    \item{There are three objects that are detected in the $W4$-band but
        not $W1$ or $W2$ (i.e., ``W1W2-dropouts''), all of which are at
        $z>2.6$.}
    \item{We identify an intriguing class of objects at $z\simeq 2-3$ which are
        characterized by equivalent widths of REW(C\,{\sc iv})
        $\gtrsim150$\AA.  These objects often also have unusual line
        properties.  We speculate that the large REWs may be caused by
        suppressed continuum emission analogous to Type 2 quasars in the
        Unified Model. However, there is no obvious mechanism in the Unified
        Model to suppress the continuum without also suppressing the broad
        emission lines, thus potentially providing an interesting challenge to
        quasar models.}
