The Near and Mid-infrared photometric properties of known redshift $z\geq5$ Quasars
 
Infrared properties of Very high-$z$ Quasars



We assemble a catalogue of 463 spectroscopically confirmed very high
($z\geq5.00$) redshift quasars and report their near- ($ZYJHK_{s}/K$)
and mid- (WISE W1234) infrared properties. 97\% of the VH$z$Q sample
is detected in one or more NIR ($ZYJHK/K_{s}$) band, with lack of
coverage rather than lack of depth being the reason for the
non-detections. 362 (78\%) of the very high redshift quasars are
detected at 3.4$\mu$m in the W1 band from the unWISE catalog and all
of the $z\geq7$ quasars are detected in both unWISE W1 and W2. Using
archival WFCAM/UKIRT and VIRCAM/VISTA data we check for photometric
variability that might be expected from super-Eddington accretion. We
find 32 of the quasars have sufficient NIR measurements and
signal-to-noise to look for variability. Weak variability was detected
in multiple bands of SDSS J0959+0227, and very marginally in the
$Y$-band of MMT J0215-0529. Two other quasars, SDSS J0349+0034 and
SDSS J2220-0101 had significant differences between their WFCAM and
VISTA magnitudes in one band.  With supermassive black hole accretion
likely to be redshift invariant up to very high-redshift, further
monitoring of these sources is warranted.  All the data, analysis
codes and plots used and generated here can be found at:
