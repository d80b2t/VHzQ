-- Table and plots of WISE detections vs. function of e.g. W1234 SNR, M_1450, redshift etc.
      273/435 at the moment??
      (MAYBE) NEEDS:: NEOWISER-R3 Meisner photometry

-- M_145 values from e.g. z-, y/Y, J-bands.
   NEEDS:: 'final' decison and discussion with Nick Cross.

-- SED rest-frame plot
   NEEDS:: Discussion/thought/calculations on upper limits..
   	   e.g. Mullaney ALMA paper??
	   
-- What else from Blain?? Jiang??






unWISE

Need some sort of
     WISE Detection vs. WISE Non-Detection plot

     WISE Detection vs. WISE Non-Detection plot
     as a function of z. (in 0.25 bins)

WHERE IS THAT NOTE OF e.g. DETECTIONS and DETCTION TABLE
as a function of e.g. z, M_1450, color etc. etc. 
???!!!!!



Blain et al. 2013::

Figure 1.
WISE color–color and color–magnitude diagrams for

       W2-W3 vs. W1-W2  ( 1.8 -  4.7)  and  (-0.2 to 2.0)
       W2    vs. W1-W2  (10.0 - 17.5)  and  (-0.2 to 2.0)

       cf. Wright et al. 2010:: 
       [4.6] - [12] in mag   vs.  [3.4] - [4.6] in mag
       W2-W3 vs. W1-W2  (-1.0 -  7.0)  and  (-0.5 to 4.0)

position in WISE bands W1, W2, W3, W4. 
  ULAS J1120+0641

Figure 3.
Results of stacking various combinations of the WISE images of z > 6 QSOs.
W1 Det, W2 Detr, W1 Non, W2 Non, W3 Det, W4 Det. 
The total number of 8s duration WISE single-exposure image frames
combined in these stacks is 300, 300, 188, 188, 297, and 297
respectively.
