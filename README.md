 Purpose
===
A repo, 
[github.com/d80b2t/VHzQ](github.com/d80b2t/VHzQ) that hosts the data, code, plots and paper for the  investigations into the highest (z>5) redshift quasars. In particular the near and mid-infrared photometric properties. 




  Directory Structure, Plots and code
==============================

Hopefully the directory structure of the repo is fairly straight forward. 
The (NIR and MIR) data are based on data here::

    /data/
and the key table is: 

	/data/VHzQs_ZYJHK_WISE.tbl
	
The 

	/light_curves/

directory has the light curve plots for the best sampled objects, with the light curve data being located in:  

    /data/WSA_VSA/
    /data/NEOWISE-R/
    /data/light_curves/
