Hi there,

I've been investigating the NEOWISE-R properties and light curves for some high-redshift quasars.

When I query the NEOWISE-R Single Exposure L1b Source Table, and ask for the
w1/2mpro profile-fit photometry magnitudes to be returned, I can potentially get up to hundreds of
values for a single object, which is great. 

However, when I look at these values and compare them to the W1mpro magnitude of the associated ALLWISE
source, i.e. the "w1mpro_allwise" values, there seems to be a systematic in that the
values for the values of (w1/2mpro - w1/2mpro_allwise) tend negative (at fainter magnitudes)
i.e. the ALLWISE values are generally larger in numercical value and are thus generally
fainter??

What's going on here??

3 plots and the parent datafile are attached.

Thannks,
Nic
