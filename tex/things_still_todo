 Still To Dos
=====================================================================



{\bf For NPR: }
=====================================================================
 -- plots_to_make
 -- Concentrate on reporting NIR and W1/W2 figures and tables
 -- SED dust plots 
 -- Filter curve plot with LSST, Euclid and even wide JWST filters...; 
 -- Check for NIR and MIR variabilty with the Wu quasar
 -- Check with SpIES/SHELA (but only 3.4/4.6$\mu$m;
 -- check UltraVISTA (NPR)

%%\item Almost certainly want to compile M$_{\rm BH}$; THIS CAN WAIT, otherwise is massive paper-creep
%%\item May well wanna try and get M$_{\star}$ too...!! (yuck); THIS CAN WAIT, otherwise is massive paper-creep



\noindent
{\bf For NJGC: }
=====================================================================

\item Write the NIR data section(s) 
- exposure time vs. depths





\noindent
{\bf For Both: }
=====================================================================

\begin{itemize}
\item Need to decide what mags and mag system we are reporting, especially in the 
NIR...
\item Depth/area QLF calculation to see whether the NIR surveys have been fully mined...
\item Question from Sarah Bosman:: are the $y$-magnitudes AB? They seem all quite a bit brighter than the ones given in Banados+16. Do you know why that is?
\end{itemize}
